### 1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the resturent?
````sql
SELECT s.customer_id, SUM(price) AS total_sales
FROM dbo.sales AS s
JOIN dbo.menu AS m
   ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY customer_id; 
````

#### Steps:
- Use **SUM** and **GROUP BY** to find out ```total_sales``` contributed by each customer.
- Use **JOIN** to merge ```sales``` and ```menu``` tables as ```customer_id``` and ```price``` are from both tables.

#### Answer:
| customer_id | total_sales |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | 76          |
| B           | 74          |
| C           | 36          |

- Customer A spent $76.
- Customer B spent $74.
- Customer C spent $36.

### 2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurent?
````sql
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(DISTINCT(order_date)) AS visit_count
FROM dbo.sales
GROUP BY customer_id;
````

#### Steps:
- Use **DISTINCT** and wrap with **COUNT** to find out ```visit_count``` for each customer.
- If we do not use **DISTINCT** on ```order_date```, the number of days may be repeated. For
example, if customer A visted the restaurant twice on '2022-05-07', then number of days is counted as 2 days insted of 1 day


#### Answer:
| customer_id | visit_count |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | 4           |
| B           | 6           |
| C           | 2           |

- Customer A visited 4 times.
- Customer B visited 6 times.
- Customer C visited 2 times.

### #. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
````sql
WITH ordered_sales_cte AS
   ( 
   SELECT customer_id, order_date, product_name,
       DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARITION BY s.customer_id)
       ORDER BY s.order_date ) AS rank
   FROM dbo.sales AS s
   JOIN dbo.menu AS m
     ON s.product_id = m.product_id
     )
     
     SELECT customer_id, product_name
 
  ````
FROM ordered_sales_cte
WHERE rank = 1
GROUP BY customer_id, product_name;
